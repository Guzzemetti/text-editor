## Objective

To develop a WebApp which users can utilize to take and edit notes with, that will be saved persistently until the user clears their storage.

```md
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

```md
GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client server folder structure
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
WHEN I register a service worker
THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
WHEN I deploy to Heroku
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
```

## Usage
To use this program, simply follow the [live link](https://serene-badlands-81860.herokuapp.com/) to it's deployed Heroku page. From here, users can utilize this page to begin taking notes, or they may choose to install it to their machine with the Install button located in the top-left corner of the page. Data entered will remain within the application until the user clears their local storage and cache options within their browser. Please note that data is saved to the browser used to access the page and will not transfer between browsers.
